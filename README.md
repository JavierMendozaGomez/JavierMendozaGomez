ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I'm Javier a Software Engineer working on Lego.

Keep Ithaka always in your mind.  
Arriving there is what youâ€™re destined for.  
But donâ€™t hurry the journey at all.  
Better if it lasts for years,  
so youâ€™re old by the time you reach the island,  
wealthy with all youâ€™ve gained on the way,  
not expecting Ithaka to make you rich.  

Ithaka gave you the marvelous journey.  
Without her you wouldn't have set out.  
She has nothing left to give you now.  

And if you find her poor, Ithaka wonâ€™t have fooled you.  
Wise as you will have become, so full of experience,  
youâ€™ll have understood by then what these Ithakas mean.
